# Html Extractor

**Tier:** 1-Intermediate

We know that today, in the routine of developers and QA's,
we often need to automate tasks. With that, we are faced with 
a scenario where we need to use web automation libraries. 

And that is the idea of ​​this project. 
Introduce to devs and QA'S the automation of
web tasks with the help of libraries made for this.

### Requirements & Constraints

- Develop a web automation, based on the routine of a DEV or QA, 
things that actually make sense to be automated.

- The idea is to inform this automation the link of a particular web page, 
and it must extract the entire tree of HTML elements.

- Bear in mind that there are scenarios where the browser should 
not be opened, and the extraction of the html tag should happen 
in the background.

- The programming languages ​​that offer good support for this type 
of application are JavaScript and Python.


## Acceptance terms

-   [ ] The page's HTML tree must be correctly extracted.
-   [ ] A use case must be created, where the browser is not opened.


## Bonus features

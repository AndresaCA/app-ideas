# CSSGram

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

One of the reasons Instagram became very famous was because of the filters that it offers. In this project you will create a clone of the Instagram filters using CSS.

## User Stories

These will cover the visual part of the project.

- [ ] The user can upload an image - accepted formats: jpg, jpeg, png
- [ ] There is a list of, at least, 5 filters that can be applied to the image by clicking on them
- [ ] A small preview of the result image is displayed next to the list of filters
- [ ] The user can download the result image by clicking on a button

## Bonus features

- [ ] The user can add a caption to the image
- [ ] When downloading the image, if it has a caption, it will look like [a photo taken with a polaroid camera](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1942489/pexels-photo-1942489.jpeg) with the text placed on the bottom of the image
